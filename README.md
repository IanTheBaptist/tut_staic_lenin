## üó∫Ô∏è About the Project

This project started as a fun way for our small group to practice mapping skills. It's an interactive map showcasing photos of Lenin monuments we've found in Belarus.

Think of it less as a complete, official database and more as a personal project created for fun. All photos and data were collected by us!

## ‚ú® Features

*   Interactive map built with [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/).
*   Click on a monument to see details and a photo in the sidebar.
*   A lightbox for a larger view of the monument's image.
*   Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
